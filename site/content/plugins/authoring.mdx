## Introduction

Litehouse plugins are WebAssembly modules that extend the functionality of the Litehouse home automation system. They can be written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly, offering a wide range of possibilities for automation, integration, and customization.

## The `build` command

The authoring workflow centers around the `build` command. This command
packages your plugin source into the litehouse plugin format which is, under
the hood, just a wasm component. For more about the `build` command, see the
[build](/docs/commands/build) command page.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start is to copy the sample plugin, `noop` in the
repository. Please see [the crate](https://github.com/arlyon/litehouse/tree/main/plugins/noop) for more,
or follow the guide below.

### Anatomy of a plugin

Lets learn a little about how to create plugins by walking through the anatomy
of the `noop` plugin and see how we can extend it. It looks a lot like a
regular rust library, but with some extra tools to set up the traits you
need to implement and define what the plugin's configuration looks like.

<Callout>
At any time you can bail out and implement the plugin the 'manual' way; as long
as it adheres to the [plugin definition](/docs/plugins), it will work. The
following is just a convenience wrapper for rust libraries.
</Callout>

To get started, you'll need to import the `litehouse-plugin` crate which
includes some convenience macros for getting started with rust, the primary
entrypoint of which is the `generate` macro. Notice that the `crate-type` is
set to `cdylib`. This is important for wasm modules as it signifies to cargo
that we intend on loading this plugin dynamically.

<div id="cargo">
```toml title="Cargo.toml" file=../../../plugins/noop/Cargo.toml
```
</div>

Looking at the `lib.rs` file, we can see that it is mostly just a regular rust
library. `generate` expects a struct which is instantiated by litehouse. You
may store any local state you like in here. The `generate` macro also generates
for you some trait and types from the plugin schema.

<div id="lib">
```rust title="src/lib.rs" file=../../../plugins/noop/src/lib.rs
//! A basic no-op plugin intended to be used as a starting point for writing
//! your own plugin.

use crate::exports::litehouse::plugin::plugin::{Event, GuestRunner, Subscription};

litehouse_plugin::generate!(NoopPlugin);

pub struct NoopPlugin;

impl GuestRunner for NoopPlugin {
    fn new(_nickname: String, _config: Option<String>) -> Self {
        Self
    }

    fn subscribe(&self) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, u32> {
        Ok(vec![])
    }

    fn update(&self, _events: Vec<Event>) -> Result<bool, u32> {
        Ok(true)
    }
}
```
</div>

<Callout type="warn">
If you forget to implement GuestRunner for your plugin, you will get a compile
error. Same for if you fail to implement the interface correctly.

<div className="pb-2 pr-8">
```sh
error[E0277]: the trait bound `NoopPlugin: GuestRunner` is not satisfied
 --> plugins/noop/src/lib.rs:6:29
  |
6 | litehouse_plugin::generate!(NoopPlugin);
  |                             ^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `GuestRunner` is not implemented for `NoopPlugin`
  |
help: this trait has no implementations, consider adding one
 --> plugins/noop/src/lib.rs:6:1`
 ```
 </div>

</Callout>

### Lifecycle

When the function is created, you will receive a nickname which is the name the
user used to instantiate the plugin. This is guaranteed to be unique. Then,
subscribe will called to opt-in to a set of event types. Subscribing to nothing
means that the server will never wake the plugin.

Lets change that to the most fundamental subscription, time.

```rust
use crate::exports::litehouse::plugin::plugin::{Event, GuestRunner, Subscription, TimeSubscription, TimeUnit, Every};

impl GuestRunner for NoopPlugin {}
    fn subscribe(&self) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, u32> {
        Ok(vec![Subscription::Time(
            TimeSubscription::Every(Every {
                amount: 1,
                unit: TimeUnit::Minute,
            }),
        )])
    }
}
```

The `update` function is called whenever an event happens in the system that
matches one of your subscriptions. For us, you'll get an update every minute.
Note that schedules do not get persisted between starts. We are considering
allowing configuring the interval relative to some point in time such as
'every 4pm'.
