description: How to use Litehouse and the various commands
---

Litehouse has a number of commands, which can be found by running `litehouse --help`. A reference for them (with some additional explainers) can be found
below.

## Run

The `run` command is what starts up an instance of Litehouse. It will search
your config file for plugin instances, boot them up, and serve them with updates.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse run
```

## Add

Add a plugin to your imports list and fetch it. If you specify a more specific
(but compatible) version, it will replace the existing one rather than append.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse add tasmota@0.1.2
```

You can also add pre-configured instances using the `add` command from, for
example, a plugin configured using the registry website. It is run just the
same.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse add #bGl0ZWhvdXNl
```

## Generate

Generate the `schema.json` file, based on the plugins in your local `wasm` folder. This provides intellisense for your `settings.json` file.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse generate
```

## Init

Initialize a new Litehouse project. This will create a `settings.json` file and a `wasm` folder.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse init
```

## Validate

Validate your `settings.json` file. This will check that all plugins are valid and that the config is correct. This is a handy sanity check that is a little
more thorough than what the intellisense can provide.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse validate
```

## Build / Publish

Build your plugin or publish it to the registry. This will make it available for others to use. Currently this only supports rust plugins. To use it, run it
from the root of your package workspace, and specify the name of the crate.
For more information, please see the [registry](/registry)!

```bash title="Terminal"
# build it to your local wasm folder
litehouse build <PACKAGE>
# or, build and publish it to the registry
litehouse publish <PACKAGE>
```

## Fetch

Fetch the plugins defined in the `imports` fields in your [settings.json](/docs/settings) from the registry.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse fetch
```

## Search

Search the registry for a plugin. This will return a list of plugins that match the search term.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse search tasmota@0.1
tasmota@0.1.0
tasmota@0.1.1
tasmota@0.1.2
```

## Lock

Lock the versions of the plugins in your `imports` field. This will hash the
versions downloaded in your `wasm` folder and apply them to your settings file,
ensuring that later [fetch](#fetch) commands will get that precise version.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse lock
```

```diff title="settings.json"
{
  "imports": [
-   "samsung@0.2.0"
+   "samsung@0.2.0~blake3:af1349b9f5f9a1a6a0404dea36dcc9499bcb25c9adc112b7cc9a93cae41f3262"
  ]
}
```

## Feedback

Tell me anything at all. Got an idea that doesn't warrant a github issue? Or
simply want to say hi? Run `litehouse feedback` and let me know! It'll be sent
directly to me. Be aware this also sends your git email and name so that we
may get in touch :)

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse feedback "This is cool, I'd like a plugin that could do my dishes..."
```
