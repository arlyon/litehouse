description: How to use Litehouse and the various commands
---

Litehouse has a number of commands, which can be found by running `litehouse --help`. A reference for them (with some additional explainers) can be found
below. They are listed roughly in order of usage. To set up a new instance:

- initialize the project
- add some plugins
- generate a schema file for your selected plugins
- add all the plugins to the settings file
- validate the settings
- run litehouse

## Init

Initialize a new Litehouse project. This will create a `settings.json` file and a `wasm` folder.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse init
```

## Add

Add a plugin to your imports list and fetch it. If you specify a more specific
(but compatible) version, it will replace the existing one rather than append.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse add tasmota@0.1.2
```

You can also add pre-configured instances using the `add` command from, for
example, a plugin configured using the registry website. It is run just the
same.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse add litehouse add tasmota@0.1.2#eyJpbnN0YW5jZSI6eyJpcCI6WzE5MiwxNjgsMSwxXX19
```

## Generate

Generate the `schema.json` file, based on the plugins in your local `wasm` folder. This provides intellisense for your `settings.json` file.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse generate
```

## Validate

Validate your `settings.json` file. This will check that all plugins are valid and that the config is correct. This is a handy sanity check that is a little
more thorough than what the intellisense can provide.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse validate
```

## Run

The `run` command is what starts up an instance of Litehouse. It will search
your config file for plugin instances, boot them up, and serve them with updates.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse run
```

## Lock

Lock the versions of the plugins in your `imports` field. This will hash the
versions downloaded in your `wasm` folder and apply them to your settings file,
ensuring that later [fetch](#fetch) commands will get that precise version.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse lock
```

```diff title="settings.json"
{
  "imports": [
-   "samsung@0.2.0"
+   "samsung@0.2.0~blake3:af1349b9f5f9a1a6a0404dea36dcc9499bcb25c9adc112b7cc9a93cae41f3262"
  ]
}
```

## Feedback

Tell me anything at all. Got an idea that doesn't warrant a github issue? Or
simply want to say hi? Run `litehouse feedback` and let me know! It'll be sent
directly to me. Be aware this also sends your git email and name so that we
may get in touch :)

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse feedback "This is cool, I'd like a plugin that could do my dishes..."
```
