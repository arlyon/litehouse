Interacting with the registry requires that you log in. This is done securely
over the command line, and allows you to edit previously uploaded plugins.
You can delete your account at any time. You can authenticate in a number of
ways but we recommend setting up passkeys.

## Login

Log in to the registry. This will open a browser window to authenticate you.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse auth login
```

## Logout

Log out of the registry by deleting your local credentials.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse auth logout
```

## Whoami

Check the currently logged-in user.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse auth whoami
```
