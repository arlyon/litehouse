Litehouse comes with a utility to build, optimise, and package plugins ready
to be uploaded to the registry.

## Build

To package a plugin as a wasm bundle, run the `build` command. litehouse does
a few things to make this work:

- Compile the plugin to wasm
- Optimise the wasm file
- Package it into a wasm-component package
- Dump it to the `wasm` folder in your workspace

Currently this only supports rust plugins. To use it, run it
from the root of your package workspace, and specify the name of the crate. To
do the optimisation and packaging steps, you will need `wasm-opt` and
`wasm-tools` on your path.

```bash title="Terminal"
> litehouse build my-plugin
* Building...
* Optimising...
* Packaging...
Done!
```

## Publish

Once you are happy with your plugin, publish it! You'll need to [authenticate](/docs/commands/auth) to the registry first.

```bash title="Terminal"
> litehouse publish my-plugin
* Publishing...
Done!
```

This may fail in the following cases:

- The plugin is already claimed by another user
- The version you are uploading already exists

If you are unsure, you can check the registry to see if the plugin is already
published.

```bash title="Terminal"
> litehouse search my-plugin
my-plugin@0.1.0
```
