## Introduction

Litehouse is designed to be decentralized, meaning you can host your own
private registries. While the capability is built in to the tool already, the
details of the protocol are still being finalized. If you would like to
self-host a registry, please get in touch with us.

## Architecture

The registry is a flat list of wasm files, alongside an index. Each plugin
contains its own metadata but to speed up reading we abstract this at three
levels:

| Level   | Description |
| ------- | ---- |
| Level&nbsp;1 | The plugins themselves. Inefficient for enumeration. |
| Level&nbsp;2 | The metadata index. This is stored as a series of flatbuffer files with an adjustable partitioning scheme. That way, if requesting a specific plugin, only a small subset of the registry needs to be downloaded. |
| Level&nbsp;3 | A single flatbuffer file with just title, version, and short description |

## Specifying the Registry

You can specify which registry an import should be sourced from by a prefix.
See [import syntax](/docs/plugins#importing-plugins) for more.
