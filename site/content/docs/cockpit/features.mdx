Right now? Not much. It is securely encrypted and fully peer-to-peer, and currently you can stream logs from your server. But we have a roadmap!

## Planned Features

### Flow-based Automations

We want you do be able to rely on Litehouse to manage automations for your home, from
simple tasks like turning on the lights when you arrive home, to more complex multi-conditional
tasks which combine decisions from multiple plugins.

This should be as easy as connecting an input to an output, and Litehouse will take care of
the rest.

### Remote Control

With these automations, Cockpit itself could become an input devide, with virtual buttons and
sliders for controlling your home. This would allow you to control your home from anywhere
in the world. For example, you could turn off your lights either from the light switch in
the kitcher, or from a button in Cockpit.

### Dashboards

We would also like to make cockpit a junction point for querying data from your litehouse
server for display either in cockpit itself, or in a dashboard such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
