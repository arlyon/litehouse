description: How to remotely interact with your litehouse instance
---

Cockpit is a zero-config way to connect to a Litehouse instance from anywhere in the world.
It works by facilitating direct peer-to-peer connections between you and your Litehouse.
No more NAT, no more public IPs, and no more port forwarding. Just authenticate your instance
and you can access it from anywhere via  [Cockpit](https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/cockpit).

All you need to do to get started is to create an account with Litehouse, while is simply
used to ensure that it is really you that is accessing your server.

## Getting Started

To opt-in to Cockpit, you must first add some settings to your `settings.json` file.

```diff title="settings.json"
{
+  "broker": {
+    "url": "https://cockpit.litehouse.arlyon.dev",
+    "password": [6, 3, 6, 3, 1, 7]
                 ------------------ make sure this is random!
+  }
}
```

To pair an instance with your account, visit the [Cockpit](https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/cockpit)
page. It will immediately scan for any running instances that are on your local network.
As a security measure, we _also_ require a password to be set, which is subject to a relatively
harsh timeout so that people on your local network are unlikely to be able to clain the server
before you do!

### Claiming the Server

Once that is set up, visit the [Cockpit](https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/cockpit) page. Your local
server should immedeately appear, and upon clicking "Begin Pairing", you will be prompted to
pick a randomly generated name, and enter the password you set up earlier. Once you do, the
server will store a secure certificate proving ownership and will be available for access.
