Litehouse is a lightweight program for home automation. Think of it as a set of
rules you define about what should happen when certain triggers are set. For
example:

<Steps>
<Step>
<h4>If it is 7am...</h4>

Set triggers at arbirary times or when receiving updates from other sources
</Step>
<Step>

<h4>Check the weather for rain</h4>

Use one of many integrations to popular APIs to fetch arbitrary data
</Step>
<Step>

<h4>Send me a text message</h4>

Pick from a variety of actions to interact with the outside world
</Step>
</Steps>

Or, alternatively...

<Steps>
<Step>
<h4>If the washing machine power consumption goes below 5W</h4>

Integrate with a wide range of home automation hardware
</Step>
<Step>

<h4>Flash the lights 10 times in the living room</h4>

Group together commands into macros and execute them in a fault tolerant way
</Step>
</Steps>

Litehouse does all these things securely and efficiently. It is designed to use minimal resources allowing it to be run on any hardware.
This is achieved by through web-assembly plugins and a custom registry allowing for extremely low idle memory usage, fast startup,
unparalleled security, and buzzwords.

### Direct

Installing the server directly can be done using `cargo`, the rust package management tool.
To install cargo, please visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) and follow the instructions.

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo install litehouse
```

Alternatively, you can install the lastest bleeding edge version with the following
command instead:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo install --git https://github.com/arlyon/litehouse litehouse
```


### Docker

Getting started with docker is an easy approach if you have docker easily available.
The docker image is lightweight, weighing in at 10MB.

```bash title="Terminal"
docker run -d \
    --name litehouse \
    -v /path/to/settings.json:/settings.json \
    -v /path/to/schema.json:/schema.json \
    -v /path/to/wasm:/wasm \
    ghcr.io/arlyon/litehouse:latest
```

<Callout title="Litehouse Docker Image">
For more information on the Litehouse Docker image, have a look at image in the [GitHub package registry](https://github.com/arlyon/litehouse/pkgs/container/litehouse).
</Callout>

#### Docker Compose

In fact, to make it a little easier, you can also take advantage of the docker-compose file
in the repo.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml" file=../../../examples/docker-compose.yaml
```

### Podman

Good news! The setup is pretty much the same as docker, but with some extra goodies.

```bash title="Terminal"
podman run -d \
    --name litehouse \
    -v /path/to/settings.json:/settings.json \
    -v /path/to/schema.json:/schema.json \
    -v /path/to/wasm:/wasm \
    ghcr.io/arlyon/litehouse:latest
```

#### Podman play kube

An alternative to docker-compose is to use a kubernetes definition file.

```yaml title="kube.yaml" file=../../../examples/kube.yaml
```

#### Podman quadlet

Quadlet is a tool built-in in podman that integrates containers into systemd
so that their lifecycles are managed in the same way as other services. This
way, logs are also routed through the regular OS journal. To set it up,
place a kube systemd service file in `~/.config/containers/systemd`. This also
has the benefit of integrating with podman's auto-update system which will
automatically check for updates at a fixed interval and restart the service.

```systemd title="litehouse.kube" file=../../../examples/litehouse.kube
```

#### Flatcar Linux / coreOS

Combining the kubernetes config and systemd, you can deploy Litehouse on
CoreOS or similar systems, using Butane to generate an Ignition configuration
file. Here's an example Butane configuration that creates a user, configures
ssh access, and uploads all the required files onto the system.

```yaml title="litehouse.bu" file=../../../examples/litehouse.bu
```

To generate the Ignition file, run butane, mounting the folder that the three
files are in into the container.

```bash
podman run --interactive -v ~/:/folder --rm quay.io/coreos/butane:release \
    --pretty --strict -d /folder < litehouse.bu > config.ign
```

### App

<Callout title="Coming soon...">
We would also like to bring a desktop app into the mix. This would allow you to run
litehouse on your laptop with a handy management UI built in.

<hr className="mt-2 mb-2" />

<div className="flex justify-between w-full items-center">
Is this something you want?

<AppRequestButton />

</div>

## Getting Set Up

We recommend running litehouse in its own folder, since it needs a few files
out of the box. To start, let's run a few commands.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse init
litehouse search tasmota
tasmota@0.1.0
tasmota@0.1.1
tasmota@0.1.2
litehouse add tasmota@0.1.2
litehouse generate
```

You will now notice a set of files in your folder.

<Files>
  <Folder name="wasm" defaultOpen>
    <File name="tasmota@0.1.2.wasm" />
  </Folder>
  <File name="schema.json" />
  <File name="settings.json" />
</Files>

- the `schema.json` file is generated by litehouse to provide intellisense
  when editing your `settings.json` file
- the `settings.json` file is where you define which plugins to use and how
- the `wasm` folder contains the downloaded plugins

Let's add a plugin [instance](/docs/terminology#instance)!

```diff title="settings.json"
{
  "$schema": "schema.json",
  "plugins": {
+  "light": {
+    "plugin": "tasmota@0.1.2",
+    "config": {
+      "ip": [192,168,1,10]
+    }
+  }
  },
  "imports": [
    "tasmota@0.1.2"
  ]
}
```

Notice that as you type, your editor knows what plugins are available, and what
the config for that plugin is. No more invalid yaml! Let's make sure that we
have everything right.

```bash title="Terminal"
litehouse validate
litehouse run
```

Congrats! You have just run your first litehouse instance.
