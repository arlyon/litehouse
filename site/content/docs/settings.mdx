## JSON Schema

The `settings.json` file is the central configuration file for Litehouse. It defines the plugins to use, their configurations, and other system-wide settings. Below is an overview of the sections you might find in a `settings.json` file.

### Imports

The `imports` section lists the plugins that your Litehouse instance will use. These can be official plugins from the Litehouse registry or custom plugins you've developed. The syntax for an import is `registry::plugin@version`.

```json
"imports": [
  "litehouse::weather@0.1.0",
  "my-registry::custom-plugin@1.2.3"
]
```

### Plugins

The `plugins` section defines instances of the plugins you've imported. Each plugin can be configured individually according to its schema.

```json
"plugins": {
  "weather_sensor": {
    "plugin": "litehouse::weather@0.1.0",
    "config": {
      "location": "New York"
    }
  }
}
```

### Capabilities

The `capabilities` section lists the capabilities that your Litehouse instance and its plugins can use. This controls access to system resources and external services, ensuring a secure environment.

```json
"capabilities": [
  "http-server:8080",
  "http-client:api.weather.com"
]
```

### Parallelism Strategies

Litehouse supports different parallelism strategies for running plugins, allowing you to balance between isolation and resource usage. The default strategy is `instance`, where each plugin instance runs in its own sandbox.

```json
"engine": {
  "sandbox_strategy": "instance"
}
```

Other strategies include `global`, where all plugins share the same sandbox, and `plugin`, where each plugin type has its own sandbox.

## Detailed Configuration
